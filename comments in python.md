## Comments in Python 

Comments in Python start with a hash symbol:

```
# this is a comment
```






Comments written using a hash can only be single line. If you want to write multi-line comment in Python, you'll have to use quotes as follows:

```
'''this is a comment




 that goes on
 
 
 
 
 
 and on
 
 
 
 
 
 and on...'''


```


Commenting your code as needed is a good way of documenting it. But make sure you're not adding comments where the code can be easily understood by just looking at it.
