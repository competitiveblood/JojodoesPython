## VARIABLES IN PYTHON ##

To declare a variable in Python, you start by writing out the name of the variable, then an equals sign, followed by the value of the variable:

```C
name = 'X'

print('My name is ' + X)
```

**OUTPUT**
```C
My name is X
```

there is no special keyword for declaring a variable


In Python, you can concatenate two strings using the plus sign. 

strings can be concatenated with strings

```C
name = 'X'
age = 27

print(f'My name is {name}')
print(f'I am {age} years old')
```

inside a f-string, you can put any valid Python statement within curly braces. This makes embedding variables or even simple logic within strings very easy.


You can re-declare your variables anywhere within the program. You can even change their types if you wish to.

```C
a = 'this is a string'

a = 10

print(a)
```

value of a will be printed as 10 since you've overridden the initial value on the second line.
