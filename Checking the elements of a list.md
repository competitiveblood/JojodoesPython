Checking the elements of a list

We can check if a list contains a certain element or not using the "in" keyword along with the "if" statement.

Eg

Write a program which does the following:

You are given a list x 


x in the console Compute and output if "Ram" is present in the given list. If present, then print "Ram is present"

x = ["Suraj","Gautam","Yash","Ram"]
if "Ram" in x :
  print("Ram is present ")
