## Data types in Python

TYPE	        EXAMPLE



Integer	         1





Floating Point	2.0






Boolean	        True





String	    'Manipal'





Integers and floating points are self-explanatory. A boolean can be either true or false, and strings in Python can be enclosed within either single quotes or double quotes. I prefer using single quotes. You may use the one you like but try not to mix both types of quotes together.
